Proj2 : Seasonal Strain Calculation

STEP01: Download and compile "Sparse" codes (Fortran legacy codes for GNSS interpolation)
        [For MAC OS X or LINUX server]

STEP02: Calculate time-dependent "Total" strain field (steady-state tectonic + nontectonic transient)


STEP03: Remove "bad" data points and re invert the remaining data points


STEP04: Obtain the steady-state tectonics


STEP05: Subtract the steady-state tectonic signals from "Total" strain 
    -> This is the nontectonic strain anomalies


STEP06: PLOT the nontectonic strain anomalies (displacement and strain fields)
