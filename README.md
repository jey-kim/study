Upload any **".ipynb"**, **".py"**, **".sh"** or **".f"** files to this repository. 

**`RULES FOR ME`** :

1. Do not use MATLAB.  
> Use Python3,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Shell scripting, or Fortran instead 
2. Name all codes starting with a proper project name  
- Proj1: GNSS position data (level 2 products provided by the NGL or GAGE facility) to preprocessed final GNSS data 
- Proj2: Seasonal Strain & Stress Analysis (Kinematics: GNSS) 
- Proj3: Seasonal Strain & Stress (Dynamics: NLDAS) 
- Proj4: Joint Inversion of GNSS and InSAR
3. Name all codes ending with the date (MMDDYYYY; if the code is NOT complete) or 'v_x_x_x' (e.g. v_1_0_0; if complete). 
4. Any input files used in a code can be saved in this repository but do not save output files.
5. Be careful to have a large file (> 100Mb). It will give you an error. 
> If the file is in the dir, try *git rm --cached filename* \
> If you already deleted the file, try *git stash* and then \
> *git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename'*
